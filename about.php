	<h1>A little about me</h1>
	<p>I grew up in southern Middle Tennessee. Music has always been a part of my life, thanks to many members of my family. Some of my earliest memories find me searching through my mom's piano bench, steeped in wonder at all the thousands of words and notes and names. How many lives they had made richer? I remember my Granddaddy's booming voice from the pew in front of me on all those early Sunday mornings.</p>
	<p>The rafters shook.</p>
	<p>In middle school, my brother showed me how cool one became when he played guitar. So I followed, as a brother does. And it was through playing guitar that I discovered my love for singing. I played in bands and showchoirs and churches and gyms, but it wasn't until college that the tiniest bud of courage broke through my arid self-doubt and I began writing my own music.</p>
	<p>I don't know exactly when or how I found photography. All I can say is one day I found myself on Ebay, having just won a bidding war for a Canon Rebel XT. Cue buyer's remorse...</p>
	<p>Then immediately cue obsession.</p>
	<p>Since then, I've been a mash of varying artistic passions, shifting from the visual to the musical to the experiential and back again. At the bottom of it all is a love for good stories, which is what I hope to tell and live well.</p>
